# XposedDex
Samsung Dex modifications through Xposed

1. Immersive Apps,
Will enable the possibility to define which apps to run in Immersive mode so they remove the titlebar when maximized.

2. Fix Keyboard,
Enables floating mode for non qwerty keyboard layouts too and fixes dark mode having a white border around the keyboard.

3. Fix Samsung Browser,
Enables secret mode (as it's disabled if Magisk installed) and disable always visible scroll bar (looks ugly under dark mode).

4. Fix Weather,
Keep displaying weather icon in the statusbar.

IMPORTANT:
Requires Magisk and edXposed installed on your tablet.
Only tested with One UI 2.1, Android 10, Build T865XXU2BTC7 so latest release for Tab S6
